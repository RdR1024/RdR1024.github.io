Currently, I lead an operational risk team for a major bank, focusing on the statistical modelling and management of extreme risk scenarios, such as cybercrimes, rogue traders and natural disasters.

For the last 25+ years I've led analytical functions, especially related to risk, business operations and information systems. Theorywise, I studied information systems at [Weber State University](http://www.weber.edu/), hold a postgraduate diploma in market modelling from [Swinburne University](http://www.swinburne.edu.au/) and completed my PhD in the applied logic of business intelligence at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/).
