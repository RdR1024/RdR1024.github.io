I am a consultant who helps organisations with analytical processes such as risk analysis, project estimates and process evaluations. Much of the work involves helping organisations make the most of the knowledge that their people have through elicitation techniques and analytical modeling. Most recently I've done a lot of work in the area of extreme operational risk scenario modelling in banking and long range scenario elicitation for defence.  Currently, I'm investigating techniques for improving quality of reasoning for intelligence analysis, as well as looking at fundamental business value in performance based contracting.

For the last 25+ years I've led analytical functions, especially related to risk, business operations and information systems. Theorywise, I studied information systems at [Weber State University](http://www.weber.edu/), hold a postgraduate diploma in market modelling from [Swinburne University](http://www.swinburne.edu.au/) and completed my PhD in the applied logic of business intelligence at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/).
