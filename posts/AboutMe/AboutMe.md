I am a consultant in analytical processes such as intelligence and risk analysis, project estimates and process evaluations. Much of the work involves helping organisations make the most of the knowledge that their people have through elicitation techniques and analytical modeling.

Most recently I've done a lot of work in the area of extreme operational risk scenario modelling in banking and long range scenario elicitation for defence.  Currently, I'm the principal platform architect for a system that improves quality of reasoning for intelligence analysis. 

For the last 25+ years I've led analytical functions, especially related to risk, business operations and information systems. Theorywise, I studied information systems at [Weber State University](http://www.weber.edu/), hold a postgraduate diploma in market modelling from [Swinburne University](http://www.swinburne.edu.au/) and completed my PhD in the applied logic of business intelligence at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/).
