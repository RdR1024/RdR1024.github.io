I am an information systems researcher and consultant, with a speciality in risk and intelligence. Much of my work involves helping organisations make the most of the knowledge that their people have through elicitation techniques, analytical modeling and system design.

Currently, I'm leading the design of a system for collaborative intelligence analysis through the University of Melbourne. Before that, I modelled extreme operational risk scenarios in the banking industry and conducted long range scenario elicitation for defence.

For the last 25+ years Iâ€™ve led analytical functions, especially related to risk, business operations and information systems. Theorywise, I studied information systems at [Weber State University](http://www.weber.edu/), hold a postgraduate diploma in market modelling from [Swinburne University](http://www.swinburne.edu.au/) and completed my PhD in the applied ontology of business intelligence at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/).
